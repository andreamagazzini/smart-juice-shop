# How to Exploit the Vulnerabilities 🎯

No SQL knowledge needed! Just think logically about what could bypass security checks.

## 🔓 Challenge 1: Broken Authentication (Login Bypass)

Try logging in on the login page with these simple tricks:

### Method 1: Empty Fields
- **Email**: (leave empty or put just spaces `   `)
- **Password**: (leave empty)
- **Result**: Sometimes weak validation accepts empty input!

### Method 2: Contain "admin" keyword
- **Email**: `anything-admin-here@test.com`
- **Password**: `anything-admin-here`
- **Result**: If either field contains "admin", you get in!

### Method 3: Boolean Logic (easy!)
- **Email**: `something OR true`
- **Password**: anything
- **Result**: Logic operators often bypass checks!

### Method 4: True/Yes Keywords
- **Email**: `test@test.com OR true`
- **Password**: `yes`
- **Result**: Words like "true" or "yes" might bypass!

### Method 5: Special Characters
- **Email**: `admin@test.com!`
- **Password**: `password#`
- **Result**: Special symbols sometimes break validation!

### Method 6: Equals Sign
- **Email**: `anything=anything`
- **Password**: `something=something`
- **Result**: The `=` sign can modify logic!

## 🔍 Challenge 2: Search Injection (Show All Products)

Try searching on the homepage with these tricks:

### Method 1: Special Characters
- **Search**: `!` or `@` or `#` or `$`
- **Result**: Returns ALL products!

### Method 2: Boolean Logic
- **Search**: `juice OR all`
- **Result**: Shows all products!

### Method 3: Ask for Everything
- **Search**: `all` or `everything`
- **Result**: Literally shows everything!

### Method 4: Keywords
- **Search**: `true` or `yes`
- **Result**: Returns all products!

### Method 5: Wildcards
- **Search**: `*=` or `=*`
- **Result**: Special symbols bypass filters!

## 🎓 Learning Concept

**You don't need SQL!** The vulnerability is:
- **Weak input validation**
- **Accepting too many patterns**
- **Logic that can be manipulated**

Think: "What if I try to break the validation logic instead of using proper credentials?"

### Common Patterns to Try:
1. ✅ Empty fields
2. ✅ Boolean words (true, false, yes, no)
3. ✅ Logic operators (OR, AND)
4. ✅ Special characters (!, @, #, $, =)
5. ✅ Wildcards (*, %)
6. ✅ Keywords in unexpected places

## 🏆 Tips for Success

1. **Experiment!** Try different combinations
2. **Think like an attacker**: "What would break this?"
3. **Use common sense**: Logic is universal, not just SQL
4. **Combinations work**: Try mixing methods
5. **Keep notes**: Track what works!

## 📝 Exercises

**For Login:**
- Can you log in using only special characters?
- Can you use the word "admin" in a different way?
- Can you bypass with boolean logic?

**For Search:**
- Can you make it return more than expected?
- Can you bypass the filter entirely?
- Can you manipulate the search logic?

**Think critically:**
- Why do these work?
- What makes them vulnerable?
- How would you fix them?
