## üéØ Recommended Teaching Methods

### 1. **Guided Discovery**
Instead of giving answers immediately:
- Ask leading questions
- Let students explore first
- Guide them when stuck
- Celebrate discoveries together

### 2. **Live Demonstrations**
- Start each challenge by showing it yourself
- Use screen sharing to show DevTools
- Point out specific clues
- React authentically to "hacks"

### 3. **Collaborative Learning**
- Pair up students for complex challenges
- Encourage discussion
- Create a supportive environment where mistakes are learning opportunities

### 4. **Real-World Connections**
- After each challenge, relate it to news stories
- Share examples of companies that suffered these attacks
- Show career opportunities in cybersecurity

## üí° Key Teaching Points

### Challenge-Specific Tips

#### Access Admin Section
- **Lead-in**: "What if you could access the admin area just by changing the URL?"
- **Aha moment**: When they realize URL protection isn't enough
- **Connection**: Many real sites had this problem in the past

#### Use Default Credentials
- **Lead-in**: "Most people never change the default password on routers"
- **Aha moment**: When IoT alarm disarms with `admin/12345`
- **Connection**: Default credentials are still #1 vulnerability for IoT

#### Session Hijacking
- **Lead-in**: "Ever heard of 'session tokens'? Let's see them!"
- **Aha moment**: Copying someone else's token and becoming them
- **Connection**: This is how hackers steal logged-in sessions

#### SQL Injection
- **Lead-in**: "What if the search function doesn't validate input?"
- **Aha moment**: `1=1` reveals hidden products
- **Connection**: Many real breaches started with SQL injection

#### Stored XSS
- **Lead-in**: "Can we inject JavaScript into product descriptions?"
- **Aha moment**: Alert shows for everyone viewing the product
- **Connection**: XSS attacks steal cookies and sessions

#### Manipulate Price
- **Lead-in**: "What if the checkout trusts browser prices?"
- **Aha moment**: Edit localStorage and checkout for free
- **Connection**: Server-side validation is always critical

‚úÖ Open their eyes to how the web works (and doesn't work)  
‚úÖ Teach them to think critically about security  
‚úÖ Inspire curiosity about cybersecurity  
‚úÖ Build awareness for their future careers  

**Have fun teaching!** Your students are about to discover a fascinating world. üçπüîê
